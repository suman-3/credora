## Overview

Issuer Authentication is a more comprehensive process than user authentication, designed specifically for institutions, organizations, and authorized parties who will issue certificates. This process includes additional verification steps to ensure legitimacy and prevent fraud.

## Authentication Requirements

### Primary Authentication
1. **Wallet Connection**: Institutional wallet address
2. **Email Verification**: Official institutional email
3. **Organization Verification**: Legal entity validation

### Additional Verification Steps
- **Domain Verification**: Prove ownership of institutional domain
- **Document Upload**: Legal authorization documents
- **Identity Verification**: Authorized representative identification

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Initial Authentication
Similar to user authentication but with institutional focus:
- Connect institutional wallet
- Provide official organization email
- Specify organization type (University, Company, Government, etc.)

### Step 2: Organization Details
**Required Information:**
- Organization name
- Legal registration number
- Physical address
- Official website
- Contact information
- Organization type/category

### Step 3: Document Verification
**Required Documents:**
- Business registration certificate
- Tax identification documents
- Authorization letter for certificate issuance
- Identity proof of authorized representative

### Step 4: Domain Verification
- Verify ownership of organization's domain
- DNS verification or file upload method
- Links email domain to organization

## Authentication Levels

### Level 1: Basic Issuer

## Verification Timeline

### Typical Processing Times
