# User Authentication

![User Authentication](/hero/metamask.png)

## Overview

The User Authentication process ensures secure access to the platform by combining wallet-based authentication with email verification. This dual-layer approach provides both security and user-friendly access management.

## Authentication Flow

### Step 1: Wallet Connection
Users must connect their digital wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) to establish their blockchain identity.

**Supported Wallets:**
- MetaMask
- WalletConnect
- Coinbase Wallet
- Trust Wallet

### Step 2: Email Verification
After successful wallet connection, users provide their email address for additional verification and platform communications.

## Technical Process

### Wallet Integration
```javascript
// Example wallet connection flow
const connectWallet = async () => {
  if (window.ethereum) {
    const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
      method: 'eth_requestAccounts'
    });
    return accounts[0];
  }
}
```

### Authentication States

#### Success Scenario
- ✅ Wallet connected successfully
- ✅ Email verified
- ✅ User proceeds to database check

#### Failure Scenarios
- ❌ **Wallet Connection Failed**: User cannot connect wallet
  - *Action*: Retry connection or try different wallet
- ❌ **Email Verification Failed**: Invalid or unverified email
  - *Action*: Re-enter email and verify
- ❌ **Network Issues**: Connection problems
  - *Action*: Check internet connection and retry

## Security Features

### Wallet Security
- **Private Key Protection**: Never stored on platform
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic proof of ownership
- **Network Validation**: Ensures connection to correct blockchain

### Email Security
- **Verification Links**: Time-limited verification emails
- **Spam Protection**: Rate limiting and validation
- **Privacy**: Email only used for essential communications

## User Experience

### Loading States
- Wallet connection progress indicator
- Email verification pending state
- Clear success/error messaging

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Troubleshooting guides
- Support contact information

## Database Integration

After successful authentication, the system:
1. Checks if user exists in database
2. Creates new user record if needed
3. Updates last login timestamp
4. Generates session token

## Privacy & Data Protection

### Data Collected
- Wallet address (public)
- Email address (encrypted)
- Login timestamps
- Platform preferences

### Data Not Collected
- Private keys
- Wallet contents
- Personal identification (unless voluntarily provided)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### MetaMask Not Detected
**Problem**: Browser doesn't detect MetaMask
**Solution**: 
- Install MetaMask extension
- Refresh page after installation
- Check browser compatibility

### Wrong Network
**Problem**: Wallet connected to wrong blockchain network
**Solution**:
- Guide user to switch networks
- Provide network configuration details

### Email Not Received
**Problem**: Verification email not received
**Solution**:
- Check spam folder
- Resend verification email
- Try alternative email address

## Next Steps
